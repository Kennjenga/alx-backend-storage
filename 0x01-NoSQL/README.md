## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

### General

- **What NoSQL means**: Understand the basics and purpose of NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data that do not fit well into traditional relational databases. They are often used for big data and real-time web applications.

- **Difference between SQL and NoSQL**: Identify key differences in structure, scalability, and use cases. For example, SQL databases use structured query language and are table-based, while NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases.

- **What is ACID**: Learn about Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability in database transactions. These properties ensure reliable processing of database transactions. For instance, in a banking system, ACID properties ensure that transactions are processed reliably.

- **Document Storage**: Understand what document storage is and how it is used in NoSQL databases. Document storage allows for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information, typically in formats like JSON or BSON.

- **NoSQL Types**: Familiarize yourself with different types of NoSQL databases (e.g., document, key-value, column-family, graph). Each type is optimized for specific types of data and use cases. For example, MongoDB is a document store, while Redis is a key-value store.

- **Benefits of NoSQL Databases**: Learn the advantages such as scalability, flexibility, and performance. NoSQL databases can scale horizontally, handle large volumes of unstructured data, and provide high performance for specific workloads.

- **Querying NoSQL Databases**: Know how to retrieve information using NoSQL query languages. For example, MongoDB uses a query language that allows for complex queries on JSON-like documents.

- **Inserting/Updating/Deleting Information**: Learn the CRUD operations in NoSQL databases. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations for managing data.

- **Using MongoDB**: Gain practical knowledge of MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. Learn how to install, configure, and use MongoDB for various data management tasks.
